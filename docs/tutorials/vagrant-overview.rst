Overview
========

There are two kinds of environments for RackHD, demo and development environment. 

RackHD runs in **Vagrant** box. Vagrant is a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments in a single workflow. 

After RackHD is set up successfully, RackHDâ€™s discovery, catalog and poller functionality will be introduced by using the simulated nodes that were defined in Vagrantfile. In addition, you have the opportunity to experiment with some RackHD APIs. In this module, you will learn about two different RESTful endpoints in RackHD and experiment with them. Besides, RackHD set up in Vagrant box is used to perform an unattended OS install onto a bare metal server.
